## Introduction

The **Linux Kernel** is a monolithic Unix-like operating system kernel initially created by **Linus Torvalds** in 1991. It serves as the core component of the Linux operating system, handling process management, memory management, device drivers, and system calls. The kernel operates on a vast range of devices, including mainframes, supercomputers, mobile phones, desktops, and embedded systems.

This repository contains the official source tree for the Linux kernel, updated regularly by a global community of contributors, including individuals, organizations, and companies. Linux development is open to anyone, and contributions are welcome.

## License

The Linux kernel is licensed under the **GNU General Public License version 2 (GPLv2)**. This license allows you to freely use, modify, and distribute the software, provided that you release any modifications under the same license. Some parts of the kernel may be covered by other licenses, but they are all compatible with GPLv2.

For more detailed licensing information, see the `COPYING` file in the root directory.

## Repository Layout

The source tree is organized into various directories. Here's an overview of the key directories and their purposes:

- **arch/**: Contains architecture-specific code (e.g., `x86`, `arm`, `riscv`, etc.).
- **block/**: Block layer and block device drivers.
- **drivers/**: Hardware drivers for various devices (e.g., networking, sound, graphics, storage).
- **fs/**: File system code, including ext4, btrfs, xfs, and others.
- **include/**: Kernel header files.
- **init/**: System and kernel initialization code.
- **ipc/**: Inter-process communication (IPC) facilities like semaphores and message queues.
- **kernel/**: Core kernel code, including process scheduling and system calls.
- **lib/**: Generic libraries used throughout the kernel.
- **mm/**: Memory management, paging, and virtual memory code.
- **net/**: Networking stack code (TCP/IP, sockets, etc.).
- **scripts/**: Helper scripts for building and maintaining the kernel.
- **security/**: Security-related code, such as SELinux, AppArmor, and kernel security modules.
- **sound/**: Sound subsystem and audio drivers.
- **tools/**: Development and diagnostic tools.
- **usr/**: Initial RAM filesystem (initramfs) code.
- **Documentation/**: Contains extensive documentation for developers and users.

## Building the Kernel

To build the kernel from source, follow the steps below. These instructions assume you're working on a Linux-based system with a properly set up development environment.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the necessary tools installed:

- **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)**
- **binutils**
- **make**
- **ncurses (for menu configuration)**
- **bison**
- **flex**
- **libssl-dev**
- **libelf-dev**

On Debian/Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential libncurses-dev bison flex libssl-dev libelf-dev
```

On Fedora/RHEL:
```bash
sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools"
sudo dnf install ncurses-devel bison flex elfutils-libelf-devel openssl-devel
```

### Cloning the Repository

Clone the official Linux kernel source tree:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/torvalds/linux.git
cd linux
```

### Configuring the Kernel

Before building the kernel, you need to configure it. You can either use an existing configuration or customize your own:

1. **Default Configuration**:
   Use the default configuration for your system architecture:
   ```bash
   make defconfig
   ```

2. **Custom Configuration**:
   Customize the kernel configuration using a menu-based interface:
   ```bash
   make menuconfig
   ```

### Building the Kernel

Once the kernel is configured, build it:

```bash
make -j$(nproc)
```

The `-j$(nproc)` flag tells `make` to use all available processor cores to speed up the build process.

### Installing the Kernel

After building the kernel, install the modules and the kernel image:

```bash
sudo make modules_install
sudo make install
```

### Updating the Bootloader

Ensure your bootloader is updated to recognize the new kernel. For systems using GRUB:

```bash
sudo update-grub
```

### Rebooting into the New Kernel

Reboot your system to load the new kernel:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

After rebooting, you can confirm that the system is running the new kernel with:

```bash
uname -r
```

## Running the Kernel

Running a custom-built kernel is straightforward once installed. However, make sure to test it thoroughly before deploying it on production systems. You can boot the new kernel by simply rebooting your machine after following the installation steps above.

## Contributing

The Linux kernel is a community-driven project. Contributions are welcome from everyone, whether you're fixing a bug, adding new features, or improving documentation. Before contributing, please familiarize yourself with the following resources:

1. **Coding Guidelines**: Follow the coding style described in `Documentation/process/coding-style.rst`.
2. **Submitting Patches**: Read `Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst` to understand how to submit patches.
3. **Maintainers**: Check the `MAINTAINERS` file to determine the right people and mailing lists for your changes.
4. **Patchwork**: Review active patches on `patchwork.kernel.org`.

To submit a patch, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch for your changes.
3. Make your changes following the coding guidelines.
4. Test your changes thoroughly.
